                <p>Have you ever heard about a poor-born man who couldn’t go to college because of its expensive cost and worked as a janitor but later become one of the richest men on Earth?<br>
                Yes, he is Tony Robbins who inspired millions of people with his enchanting words and distinctive voice. Tony Robbins is the world's premiere "performance coach," a job that entails selling out stadiums with life coaching seminars and serving as a sort of leadership consultant to clients like billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. It's also a career path he carved out for himself.<br><br>
                Tony Robbins was born and grown up in California in 1960. He was the eldest of three children and his parents divorced when he was 7. His mother married more than once, and she was addicted to drugs and alcohol and was physically abusive. He attended Glendora High School. He was elected student body president in his senior year. While growing up, Robbins worked as a handyman to help provide for his siblings. One day his family was in total poverty and had no money to buy food. The house was full of screams and suddenly, there was a miracle. Someone knocked on the door and when tony opened, he found a box full of food. That moment touched him deep and he promised himself that he would help people one day the same way his family was helped. When he was seventeen years old, he left home and never returned but he still helped his family with the money he earned from his small jobs. Robbins later worked as a janitor and did not attend college. At that time, he faced many problems as he didn’t find a house and didn’t have much money to rent or buy one. But, he never gave up, as he believed as he said, “Every problem is a gift; without problems, we would not grow.”<br><br>
                These problems were a gift that changed his life as that time he decided to go pave his path in education. In his adolescence, he read nearly 100 books a year. He was reading in psychology and philosophy. One day, everything changed. Robbins heard from a friend about a famous motivational speaker who was hiring called Jim Rohn. So, he found it as the perfect opportunity to email the speaker.  Soon his request was accepted, and Robbins began to work and learn from him. Through the experience from Jim, Robbins began to give his own seminars to motivate people, from prices ranging from 35$ to 5000$. But Robbins didn’t stop here, he continued to grow and develop until he was a featured speaker at the 2007 Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED) conference. Two years later, the huge success of his first book 'Unlimited Power' launched him into the mainstream. Robbins has coached some of the world's most high-profile people, including Oprah Winfrey, Andre Agassi, Bill Clinton, Paul Tudor Jones, Serena Williams, Leonardo DiCaprio, Nelson Mandela, Princess Diana, and Mother Teresa. Tony Robbins is currently the most respected motivational speaker in the world. He's also quietly built an empire as he has now more than 33 companies. The Anthony Robbins Company isn't just limited to his speaking engagements; it's a diversified group of businesses in industries such as hospitality, education, media production, and business services. Despite his never-ending fame and wealth, he never forgot the promise he made in his young days; He donated to more than 50 million people around the world to feed them.<br><br>
                In conclusion, despite all the conditions and challenges you face in your face, you should never succumb to them. Robbins is just a great example among many of people who never gave up in their path although the path wasn’t ideal.
