                    <p>There is no doubt that Nelson Mandela was one of the most inspiring influential icons in human being history. Affected by his community standards at his time, he spent his life defending freedom and race equality. The first black president of South Africa has suffered and faced numerous difficulties, obstacles, and injustice until he became the most venerable leader in the history of South Africa.<br><br> Rolihlahla Mandela was born in the village of Mvezo in South Africa on July 18, 1918. His father was a principal counselor of the Thembu tribe. Rolihlahla attended primary school in Qunu, being the first member of his family to enter school, where his teacher gave him the name “Nelson”. Unfortunately, Rolihlahla’s father died when he was 12, leaving his son facing life difficulties alone.<br>
                        In 1939, Nelson started his university education in Fort Hare university then Witwatersrand university where he studied law. During his university years, Mandela and his black mates were exposed to racism and apartheid from their teachers and even the principle. For instance, the principle has dismissed Mandela one time for 2 weeks as a punishment for him.<br><br>Mandela joined the African National Congress in 1944 as a step in the resistance against the ruling National Party’s apartheid policies. Mandela was arrested in 1962 and condemned to five years’ imprisonment with hard labor. Unfortunately, On June 12, 1964, Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment at Robben Island Prison, where he combatted Tuberculosis.<br>After 27 years of imprisonment, Mandela finally was released. All these tragedies that he faced throughout his life did not affect his ambition towards the cause he fought for, they just made him stronger. Thus, he became the first black president of South Africa in 1994. In addition to being the president of the African National Congress and establishing the Nelson Mandela Foundation for children, he won the honored Nobel peace prize. He was the first one to give black people in South Africa the right for voting. In fact, Mandela settled the constitutions of the Republic of South Africa.<br><br>Nelson Mandela is a role model who fought for his cause and his people as he was their symbol of patience and diligence. He did not only conquer for his cause; he also changed the way that the world looks for black people. Mandela proved that success and urbanization only depend on hard work, a person’s mind, good planning, effort exerted, and creativity, not on people’s race or skin color. Mandela left an imprint that will still engraved in our minds, and we all should learn from.</p>
